# Library - Book Tracker

## Status
Complete

## Overview

A book tracker made using Vite TypeScript and Vanilla JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind. The project idea came from the Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Section and I believe this was a good idea to help me practice Typscript and Tailwind.
